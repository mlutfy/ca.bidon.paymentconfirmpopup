Payment Confirmation Popup
==========================

On Contribution public forms, display a popup confirmation before submitting
the form. This usually goes well with disabling the CiviCRM confirmation page.

Features
========

On a contribution page, if you disable the "confirmation page", this
extension will instead display a confirmation popup with the name, e-mail
address and amount that were entered in the form. This way you can at
least be sure that the most critical details have been confirmed.

Use-cases supported:

* A contribution page with pre-defined amounts (aka the most common use-case).
* A contribution page with the "other amount" field.

Requirements
============

- CiviCRM >= 4.2 (4.4 recommended)
